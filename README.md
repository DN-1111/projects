📊 Data Analytics Portfolio

Welcome to my Data Analytics Projects Repository - a collection of end-to-end analytics projects demonstrating expertise in Python, SQL, Tableau, and PowerPoint.
Each project focuses on transforming raw data into actionable insights through data cleaning, feature engineering, visualization, and storytelling.

🚀 Projects Overview
1. 🕵️ Patterns of Deception: Credit Card Fraud Analysis
   - Tools: Python (Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Seaborn), Tableau, PowerPoint
   - Cleaned and analyzed 284K+ transactions, identifying that over 50% of frauds occur in low-value (<€10) transactions and off-peak hours.
   - Designed a KPI-driven Tableau dashboard to visualize fraud trends, transaction ranges, and PCA feature correlations (V1–V28).
   - Delivered strategic recommendations such as enhanced off-peak monitoring and tighter controls for small-value transactions.


2. ⚡ Codex Energy Drink: Market & Consumer Analysis
   - Tools: MySQL, Tableau, PowerPoint
   - Queried and analyzed 10K+ customer survey & sales records to reveal regional preferences, pricing sensitivity, and competitor positioning.
   - Created dynamic Tableau dashboards to explore brand perception, demographics, and usage patterns.
   - Recommended data-backed strategies for product positioning and customer segmentation.


3. 📞 Customer Churn Analysis
   - Tools: Python (Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Seaborn)
   - Analyzed 7,043 telecom customers to uncover churn drivers across tenure, contract type, and payment method.
   - Suggested actionable retention tactics such as loyalty offers and contract-based incentives.
   - Documented the full analysis with clear annotations and reproducible Jupyter notebooks.


4. 🚗 Road Crash Severity & Pattern Analysis
   - Tools: MySQL, Tableau
   - Cleaned and transformed 2,800+ crash records with 6,500+ fatalities and 7,700+ injuries.
   - Wrote 15+ SQL queries using CTEs, CASE, window, and date functions to identify state-wise risk zones and high-fatality vehicle pairings.
   - Developed an interactive Tableau dashboard visualizing severity trends, demographics, and geography-based patterns.


5. 🌿 Vanishing Green: Pollution & Tree Loss Analysis
   - Tools: Tableau, PowerPoint
   - Analyzed 13 years of environmental data to visualize deforestation and pollution trends through maps, line, and stacked bar charts.
   - Identified high-impact regions and key pollution drivers, supporting policy-level environmental action plans.
   - Translated findings into a storytelling presentation for non-technical stakeholders.
