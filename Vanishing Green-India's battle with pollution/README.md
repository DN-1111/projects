**🌿 Vanishing Green: India's Battle with Pollution**

**Overview**

This project visualizes India’s deforestation and pollution trends using a multi-section Tableau dashboard. The analysis highlights the scale of tree destruction, environmental impact across states, pollution causes, incident recovery status, and government response time. The goal is to support environmental awareness and data-driven policy decisions.

**Tools Used**
* Tableau Public – Dashboard design & visual storytelling
* PowerPoint – Summary presentation
* Kaggle Dataset – Environmental incident & pollution data

**Objectives**
* Visualize trends in deforestation and air pollution
* Identify the most affected states and districts
* Show the status of environmental recovery efforts
* Raise awareness through an accessible and insightful dashboard

**Tableau Dashboard**

**Key Insights**
* 757K+ trees destroyed over the recorded period
* Industrial zones and non-protected areas show higher tree loss
* State-wise variation: Gujarat, Punjab, and West Bengal face the highest combined impact
* Recovery status varies widely across causes — illegal dumping had the lowest recovery
* Rural river-polluted regions reported greater ecological vulnerability
* AQI comparison indicates states with poor air quality also faced severe vegetation loss

**What I Learned**
* Designing theme-based Tableau dashboards for environmental analytics
* Using layout, colors, and grouping to strengthen visual storytelling
* Cleaning and merging multi-source environmental datasets
* Creating KPI cards, maps, donut charts, and insights for public-facing dashboards
