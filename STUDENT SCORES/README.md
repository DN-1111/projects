-> Student Performance Analysis
This project analyzes student performance data to identify how various factors—such as gender, parental education, lunch type, test preparation, and extracurricular habits—affect scores in math, reading, and writing. The analysis is performed using Python (Pandas, Seaborn, Matplotlib), with clear visualizations and actionable insights.

-> Tools & Technologies
Python
Pandas & NumPy

-> Key Insights
Test preparation has the strongest positive effect on all subject scores.
Standard lunch and regular sports practice are linked to higher scores.
Parental education and weekly study hours correlate positively with academic performance.
Transport method and number of siblings show minimal influence.

-> Recommendations
Promote access to test prep programs.
Encourage healthy study habits and physical activity.
Provide nutritional support for students on reduced/free lunches.
Use data-driven insights to inform education policy and student support.
