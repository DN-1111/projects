📊 Student Performance Analysis with Python

📁 Project Overview
This project analyzes a dataset containing student demographic, lifestyle, and academic data to uncover factors that influence performance in Math, Reading, and Writing. It combines data wrangling, visualization, and insight generation using Python libraries.

🧰 Tools & Technologies
- Python (Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Seaborn)
- Jupyter Notebook
- Data Visualization
- Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

🎯 Objectives
- Identify how variables like gender, ethnic group, parent education, lunch type, test preparation, and study hours affect scores.
- Visualize trends using bar plots, stacked charts, and heatmaps.
- Summarize key patterns and generate recommendations for improving student performance.

📈 Key Findings
- Test preparation has the strongest positive effect on all subject scores.
- Standard lunch and regular sports practice are linked to higher scores.
- Parental education and weekly study hours correlate positively with academic performance.
- Transport method and number of siblings show minimal influence.

✅ Recommendations
- Promote access to test prep programs.
- Encourage healthy study habits and physical activity.
- Provide nutritional support for students on reduced/free lunches.
- Use data-driven insights to inform education policy and student support.
